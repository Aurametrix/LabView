Graphical programming languages provide a different method of coding. Instead of the high level statements in procedural languages, like C and Object-Oriented languages like C++ or Java, graphical languages are coded by selecting objects, connecting them, and adding functionality.

High level languages allow developers to design programs by focusing on the tasks required. The programs are developed using the statements provided and must be compiled and linked, producing an executable file of machine level code. When executed, the code is stepped through and directs the processor to perform operations; the data is accessed or stored in memory as needed.

Graphical languages usually are developed using a graphical interface, where elements are selected and the underlying sections, where functionality is added. The details are dependent on the language.

LabVIEW is a product of National Instruments (NI). It requires licenses, although student and trial packages are available. You can learn more about LabVIEW at the LabVIEW Maker Hub.  A student edition was used for this article. Files created have a file type of *.vi. Installed, LabVIEW presents an integrated development, test and run environment.

LabVIEW was designed to support a laboratory environment and is targeted to applications to control and monitor equipment. To support this effort, NI has a wide selection of hardware interfaces and meters to enable LabVIEW programs to monitor and control electronic equipment. Signals from the hardware interfaces can be read directly by the program and the data acted upon. There are also simulation controls, file read/write and circuit controls. Knowing the engineering behind the process to be controlled and measured is as important as knowing LabVIEW. The website allaboutcircuits.com has several projects using LabVIEW; be sure to check them out.

LabVIEW is used to test various equipment, like RF modules to verify the RF output power is within specifications. 
An RF power meter is needed to interface to the RF modules. The meter provides measurements that can be read by the program, which compares the measured power to the specification. Output can be files or any of the visual displays and graphs included in the controls menu.

Coding in LabVIEW
When you bring up a new project, two windows open, a Front Panel and the Block Diagram.

The Front Panel window provides tools menus and all the controls needed for the application. Programming is done by selecting functional controls in the Front Panel window; if appropriate, a corresponding block is added to the Block Diagram.
