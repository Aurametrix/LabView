few processors like ARM also support direct JAVA byte code execution

Embedded C: ARM C/C++ Compiler is of high performance 

Executing Perl scripts in LabVIEW

System Exec vi, using Windows batch (*.bat) files, or simply calling the Perl script using bash.exe from a batch file.
In LabVIEW - just pass the path of the batch file into the command input of System Exec and run the vi. The file runs and the output is reported.
